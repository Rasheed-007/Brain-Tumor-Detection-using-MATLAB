# Brain-Tumor-Detection-using-MATLAB

MATLAB Code for some minor projects In these file there are code for Brain Tumor Detection Using MATLAB code in which The 'KNN model for data trainig" file contains KNN model fro training from which you have to train the data after you tarined the data you have to test your model for its prediction accuracy after you satisfied with accuracy you can use the "MATLAB code for Results" Code to use the model for practical use where you have gice image of brain tumor image and it is going to verify it
